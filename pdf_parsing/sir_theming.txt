Categorization of SIRs/Themes 

Severe SIRs: 
- Safety and Violence: Incidents involving physical assault, staff-on-youth violence, youth-on-youth violence, sexual abuse, threats, youth death,  or serious safety risks.
- Restraint and seclusion: Use of physical restraints, mechanical restraints, seclusion/isolation, or any incident suggesting excessive force or unsafe de-escalation practices.
- Medical and mental health concerns: Suicidal ideation, self-harm, medication errors, missed medical care, emergency hospitalizations, or unmet treatment needs.

Moderate SIRs:
- Administrative or Rights-Related Issues: Inappropriate discipline, denial of services (schooling, visits), policy violations, or incidents that raise compliance/fidelity questions.
- Environmental or supervision failures: Runaways, youth-on-youth conflict escalating due to lack of supervision, unsafe physical environment, contraband, or facility-level breakdowns (e.g. understaffing). 
- Staff misconduct that does not involve violence: staff using inappropriate tone or language towards youth, staff making threats like “i’ll write you up” or “you won’t get phone time” or unprofessional boundaries (oversharing personal information or favoritism). 

Low SIRs:
- Administrative or paperwork issues: missing signatures on required forms, minor documentation errors, late submission of a report or service plan. Paperwork issues that signal training or workflow issues, not safety concerns. 
- Policy compliance errors (non-safety): Staff not completing required training hours on time, small deviations from daily schedule guidelines, or failure to update youth’s case file on schedule. 
- Facility condition issues (non-hazardous): Paint peeling, broken furniture that isn’t a safety hazard, missing posters or required signage.
