The causes cited are individual worker performance, scheduling conflicts due to illness/vacation/death in family, and case transfer when a worker left the agency. There is no mention of understaffing, failure to meet ratios, operating below minimums, shift coverage gaps, or insufficient personnel as a cause or contributing factor."

The narrative states 'There was insufficient staff to stop the fight sooner' as part of the allegation, and multiple interviews confirm only two staff were present instead of the usual three. Staff directly attributed their inability to control the situation and use restraints to not having enough personnel."

The violation was established for failing to follow the internal supervision policy (line of sight), not due to insufficient staffing levels, ratios, or coverage gaps. Staff were present and the required ratio was met, but their positioning and supervision practices were inadequate."

The violations stem from improper use of physical interventions, failure to follow CPI restraint protocols, lack of documentation, and individual staff misconduct. Three staff members were present during the incident, and the analysis focuses on their inappropriate actions and failure to follow policies, not staffing levels."
